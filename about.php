							<h2>About Me</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>My name is Krishin Pillay, and I'm a fantasy fiction writer, author of Victorious Destiny I. I'm also a guitarist in the rock band Scarlet Collider.</p>

							<p>The idea for the VIctorious Destiny series was born in 2014. It was a single dream featuring my sisters, Celeste and Genevieve and I. It has been a long and wonderful journey bringing this story to life. It is the first installment in a series spanning several eras in time and several complex and intriguing characters.</p>

							<p>I'm a native of South Africa. I studied computer science at the University of Kwazulu Natal in Durban, South Africa. I am currently employed as a software developer at a large financial company. My goal is to change my profession from software developer to published author. It's a big dream, one that starts with a single novel.</p>

							<p>I would love to hear from you. If you would like to contact me, scroll down and send me a message or reach me on any of my social media.</p>
